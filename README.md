The bible. 

The code requires some reverse-eng to re-understand. Plus the fact it was done on DOS with hebrew characters (Ascii 128 stands for Aleph).

The commit is without

- bible.txt 1.42 MB
- bible.gim 46 KB (for gematria)

A nice fact: as we need only 27 letters plus period and space (maybe more, I can't remember), 5 bits are enough, so silly compression done to put it on old 1.44 floppy.
